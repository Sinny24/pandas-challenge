Module 4 Challenge - School Statistics Analysis

District Summary:

In this challenge, we will be analyzing statistics of different schools using Pandas. We aim to create a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame.

The district summary will include the following metrics:

- Total number of unique schools
- Total students
- Total budget
- Average math score
- Average reading score
- Percentage of students passing math
- Percentage of students passing reading
- Percentage of students overall passing (passing both math and reading)

School Summary:

We will also create a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school. The school summary will include the following metrics for each school:

- School name
- School type
- Total students
- Total school budget
- Per student budget
- Average math score
- Average reading score
- Percentage of students passing math
- Percentage of students passing reading
- Percentage of students overall passing (passing both math and reading)

Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing):

To identify the top-performing schools, we will sort the schools by the percentage of overall passing in descending order and display the top 5 rows. The results will be saved in a DataFrame called "top_schools."

Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing):

Similarly, we will sort the schools by the percentage of overall passing in ascending order to identify the lowest-performing schools and display the top 5 rows. The results will be saved in a DataFrame called "bottom_schools."

Math Scores by Grade:

We will calculate the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school and create a DataFrame to display the results.

Reading Scores by Grade:

Similarly, we will calculate the average reading score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school and present the results in a DataFrame.

Scores by School Spending:

We will create a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges per student. The spending ranges will be categorized using the provided bins, and then we will calculate mean scores and passing percentages per spending range. The results will be saved in a DataFrame called "spending_summary."

Scores by School Size:

To analyze the impact of school size on performance, we will categorize schools into small, medium, and large based on the provided size bins. Then, we will calculate and analyze the performance metrics for each category.

Let's proceed with the analysis to gain valuable insights into the district's school performance!
